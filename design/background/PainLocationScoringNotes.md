- Implement in TypeScript
- Assume that a body map has already been created externally in an independent concept (e.g., by BodyMapGeneration) and is provided as an argument.  
- Do **not** add functions that create maps internally; only validate that the provided map exists.    
- Include ownership checks and clear error messages for precondition failures.
