**Notable design changes encountered when implementing front-end**

- Added specifications that the state of the current map (any regions scored and saved) has to be retained when navigating the archived maps.
- Created a feature for users to be able to directly export the Pain Summary rather than have to screenshot it (based on Assignment 2 feedback).
- (Change from check-in) Formatted the entire page to be compact and users don't have to scroll to access different parts of the body map.

Overall, I don't think much has really changed from the initial specs of the concepts to the prototype implementation but these were a few things that I specifically focused on!
