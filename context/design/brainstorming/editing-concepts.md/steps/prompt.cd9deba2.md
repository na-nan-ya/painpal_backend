# prompt: Maintain the existing format and structure, but factor in best practices for concept design. Edit the PainPal concept specification to include the following

* Users should register for an account with an email id and password. They need to login to their existing account before using any actions.
* The actions generateMap and saveMap should follow a one map per day, per user time model.
* Add actions to allow users to edit and delete a breakthrough.
* Include an export action specification that allows users to save a bodyMap as a pdf
