# PainPal Concept Specification

## 1. Introduction
PainPal is a conceptual system designed to help users track and manage chronic pain through visual representations. It aims to provide insights into pain patterns and potential breakthroughs.

## 2. Core Entities

### 2.1 User
*   **Description:** An individual using the PainPal system.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): Unique system identifier for the user.
    *   `emailId` (String): User's unique email address, used for account registration and login.
    *   `passwordHash` (String): Hashed password for security.
    *   `painProfile` (Object): Stores user's general pain information (e.g., type, duration).

### 2.2 BodyMap
*   **Description:** A visual representation of a user's pain distribution on a human body outline.
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `mapId` (UUID): Unique identifier for the body map.
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the user who owns this map.
    *   `dateCreated` (Date): The specific date for which the map was created (YYYY-MM-DD). This ensures uniqueness per day per user.
    *   `painPoints` (Array of Objects): Each object represents a pain point with:
        *   `location` (String/Coordinates): Specific anatomical location (e.g., "lower back", `{x: 0.5, y: 0.3}`).
        *   `intensity` (Integer 1-10): Pain level.
        *   `description` (String, optional): User-added details about the pain.
    *   `associatedBreakthroughs` (Array of UUIDs): Links to breakthroughs recorded on this date or relevant to this map.

### 2.3 Breakthrough
*   **Description:** A significant event or observation related to pain management (e.g., a new medication, a specific activity that reduced pain, a change in symptoms).
*   **Attributes:**
    *   `breakthroughId` (UUID): Unique identifier for the breakthrough.
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the user who recorded this breakthrough.
    *   `dateRecorded` (Timestamp): Date and time the breakthrough was recorded.
    *   `type` (String): e.g., "Medication Change", "Activity Insight", "Symptom Shift".
    *   `description` (String): Detailed explanation of the breakthrough.
    *   `impact` (String, optional): User's perceived impact on pain (e.g., "significant improvement", "slight worsening").

## 3. Core Actions

**Authentication Requirement:** Users must register for an account using a unique email ID and a password. They are required to successfully log in to their existing account before performing any actions that access or modify their personal data.

### 3.1 registerUser
*   **Description:** Allows a new user to create an account.
*   **Input:**
    *   `emailId` (String): Desired unique email address for the account.
    *   `password` (String): Desired password for the account.
*   **Output:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): On successful registration.
    *   `error` (String): On failure (e.g., email already registered, invalid password format).

### 3.2 loginUser
*   **Description:** Authenticates an existing user.
*   **Input:**
    *   `emailId` (String): User's registered email address.
    *   `password` (String): User's password.
*   **Output:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): On successful login.
    *   `sessionToken` (String): For subsequent authenticated requests.
    *   `error` (String): On failure (e.g., invalid credentials).

### 3.3 generateMap
*   **Description:** Allows a user to create a new BodyMap for a specific date. This action initializes the daily map.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `date` (Date): The specific date for which the map is being generated (YYYY-MM-DD).
    *   `painPoints` (Array of Objects): Initial pain points to be recorded on the map.
*   **Output:**
    *   `mapId` (UUID): On successful map generation.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.
*   **Constraints:** A user can generate only one new BodyMap per day. Attempting to generate a second map for the same day will result in an error, indicating that a map already exists for that date and prompting the user to use `saveMap` to update it.

### 3.4 saveMap
*   **Description:** Updates an existing BodyMap with new or modified pain points and associations. This action is used to modify the daily map after it has been generated.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `mapId` (UUID): ID of the map to be updated.
    *   `painPoints` (Array of Objects): Updated list of pain points.
    *   `associatedBreakthroughs` (Array of UUIDs, optional): Breakthroughs to associate or disassociate.
*   **Output:**
    *   `success` (Boolean): True if update was successful.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.
*   **Constraints:** This action updates an *existing* BodyMap. The "one map per day, per user" model implies that this action will always modify the single map generated for its `dateCreated`.

### 3.5 recordBreakthrough
*   **Description:** Allows a user to record a new breakthrough event.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `dateRecorded` (Timestamp): Date and time of the breakthrough.
    *   `type` (String): Type of breakthrough (e.g., "Medication Change").
    *   `description` (String): Detailed explanation of the breakthrough.
    *   `impact` (String, optional): User's perceived impact (e.g., "significant improvement").
*   **Output:**
    *   `breakthroughId` (UUID): On successful recording.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.

### 3.6 editBreakthrough
*   **Description:** Allows a user to modify the details of an existing breakthrough.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `breakthroughId` (UUID): ID of the breakthrough to edit.
    *   `newType` (String, optional): New type for the breakthrough.
    *   `newDescription` (String, optional): New detailed explanation.
    *   `newImpact` (String, optional): New perceived impact.
*   **Output:**
    *   `success` (Boolean): True if update was successful.
    *   `error` (String): On failure (e.g., breakthrough not found, not owned by user).

### 3.7 deleteBreakthrough
*   **Description:** Allows a user to remove a previously recorded breakthrough from their history.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `breakthroughId` (UUID): ID of the breakthrough to delete.
*   **Output:**
    *   `success` (Boolean): True if deletion was successful.
    *   `error` (String): On failure (e.g., breakthrough not found, not owned by user).

### 3.8 viewMapHistory
*   **Description:** Retrieves a list of all BodyMaps recorded by a user, typically ordered by date.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
*   **Output:**
    *   `maps` (Array of BodyMap objects): List of BodyMaps.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.

### 3.9 viewBreakthroughHistory
*   **Description:** Retrieves a list of all breakthroughs recorded by a user.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
*   **Output:**
    *   `breakthroughs` (Array of Breakthrough objects): List of breakthroughs.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.

### 3.10 exportMapAsPdf
*   **Description:** Generates and provides a downloadable PDF document of a specific BodyMap. The PDF should visually represent the body outline with marked pain points (including intensity and descriptions), the date of the map, and any associated breakthroughs/notes for that day.
*   **Input:**
    *   `userId` (UUID): ID of the current user.
    *   `mapId` (UUID): ID of the BodyMap to export.
*   **Output:**
    *   `pdfFile` (Binary/Link): A downloadable PDF file of the BodyMap.
    *   `error` (String): On failure.

## 4. User Interface Considerations
*   Interactive body outline for precise pain point selection and intensity marking.
*   Calendar view for navigating daily maps and breakthroughs.
*   Intuitive forms for recording, editing, and deleting breakthrough entries.
*   Option to download a BodyMap as a PDF from a map viewing screen.
*   Clear visual feedback on the "one map per day" constraint (e.g., disabling 'create new map' button if a map for today already exists, or redirecting to edit).

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements
*   **Security:** User data, especially pain information and passwords, must be protected with industry-standard encryption and hashing techniques. User authentication (login) must be secure.
*   **Scalability:** The system should be designed to efficiently handle a growing number of users and their daily BodyMap and breakthrough data without significant performance degradation.
*   **Usability:** The interface must be intuitive, easy to learn, and efficient for users to track and manage their pain.
*   **Data Integrity:** The "one map per day, per user" constraint must be strictly enforced by the backend logic to ensure data consistency.
*   **Reliability:** The system should be robust and available, minimizing downtime and data loss.
