# response:

To implement `PainLocationScoring`, we'll follow the common interpretation where the score is simply the count of *unique* reported pain locations. This is a robust and widely applicable method when no specific weighting or complex rules are provided.

### Concept Specification (Assumed for implementation)

* **Concept Name:** PainLocationScoring
* **Purpose:** To quantify the spread or number of distinct anatomical locations where pain is reported.
* **Input:** A list of strings, where each string represents a reported pain location.
* **Output:** An integer score.
* **Logic:** The score is calculated as the total number of unique strings (pain locations) present in the input list. Duplicate entries for the same location are counted only once. The comparison of location strings is case-sensitive by default.

### Python Implementation

```python
from typing import List, Set

def calculate_pain_location_score(pain_locations: List[str]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates a pain location score based on the number of unique reported locations.

    The score is determined by counting the number of distinct pain locations
    provided in the input list. Each unique location contributes 1 point to the
    total score.

    By default, the comparison of locations is case-sensitive. For example,
    "head" and "Head" would be considered two different locations. If
    case-insensitivity is desired, the input list should be pre-processed
    (e.g., by converting all strings to lowercase) before calling this function.

    Args:
        pain_locations: A list of strings, where each string represents a
                        reported pain location (e.g., "head", "left knee", "back").
                        The order of locations does not matter. Duplicate entries
                        for the same location will only be counted once.

    Returns:
        An integer representing the pain location score. Returns 0 if the input
        list is empty.
    """
    if not pain_locations:
        return 0

    # Use a set to automatically handle unique locations
    unique_locations: Set[str] = set(pain_locations)
    return len(unique_locations)

# --- Example Usage ---
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print("--- PainLocationScoring Examples ---")

    # Example 1: No pain locations
    locations_1 = []
    score_1 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_1)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_1} -> Score: {score_1}") # Expected: 0

    # Example 2: Single unique pain location
    locations_2 = ["head"]
    score_2 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_2)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_2} -> Score: {score_2}") # Expected: 1

    # Example 3: Multiple unique pain locations
    locations_3 = ["head", "left arm", "right leg", "neck"]
    score_3 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_3)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_3} -> Score: {score_3}") # Expected: 4

    # Example 4: Duplicate pain locations (should only count once)
    locations_4 = ["back", "left leg", "back", "right arm", "left leg"]
    score_4 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_4)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_4} -> Score: {score_4}") # Expected: 3 (unique: "back", "left leg", "right arm")

    # Example 5: Case sensitivity
    # "Head" and "head" are treated as different by default.
    locations_5 = ["head", "Head", "neck"]
    score_5 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_5)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_5} -> Score: {score_5}") # Expected: 3

    # Example 5b: Achieving case-insensitivity by pre-processing
    locations_5b = ["head", "Head", "neck"]
    # Convert all to lowercase before passing
    normalized_locations_5b = [loc.lower() for loc in locations_5b]
    score_5b = calculate_pain_location_score(normalized_locations_5b)
    print(f"Locations (normalized): {normalized_locations_5b} -> Score: {score_5b}") # Expected: 2 (unique: "head", "neck")

    # Example 6: More complex list
    locations_6 = ["lower back", "upper back", "left shoulder", "right shoulder", "left knee", "right knee", "left knee"]
    score_6 = calculate_pain_location_score(locations_6)
    print(f"Locations: {locations_6} -> Score: {score_6}") # Expected: 6 (unique: "lower back", "upper back", "left shoulder", "right shoulder", "left knee", "right knee")
```
