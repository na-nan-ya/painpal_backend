# prompt: Modify the console messages and testing results of the PainLocationScoring test suite to look more user-friendly, clean, and readable like the BodyMapGeneration test suite. Do not display the entire id of each map and region, simply abstract them to representative Strings when printing. Ensure that all of the arguments and results of your actions are either primitive values (strings, numbers, etc) or object identifiers (actually document identifiers in MongoDB). Composite objects should be used only inside concept implementations and never exposed.
