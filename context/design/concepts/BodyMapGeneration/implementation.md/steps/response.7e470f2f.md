# response:

To implement the `generateMap()` action for the `BodyMapGeneration` concept, we first define the concept's minimal specification based on the prompt's requirements. The key constraints are that it's a "generic body outline" and "NO notion of body measurements." This means the concept only needs to record that a user has *a* generic body map, represented by a unique ID, without storing the actual map data or any related measurements within this concept itself.
