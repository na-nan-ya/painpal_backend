# prompt: One of the test cases is wrong. A user should NOT be able to generate a map on their own. It is a system action that occurs automatically every 24 hours (at midnight). Similarly, when a new map is generated, the current one is automatically saved. So, a user cannot generate more than one map on a given day. Change the test suite to reflect that.
